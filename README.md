# Material Darker JupyterLab Extension

This is my port of the [Material Darker theme](http://equinsuocha.io/material-theme/#/darker) for JupyterLab. It's a work in progress.

## Install

```
jupyter labextension install @yutiansut/jupyterlab_materialdarker
```

After launching JupyterLab, select the `Material Darker` theme from the main menu: `Settings` > `JupyterLab Theme` > `Material Darker QUANTAXIS Special`
